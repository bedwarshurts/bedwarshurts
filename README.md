# Hello there 👋
*“The reading of all good books is indeed like a conversation with the noblest men of past centuries who were the authors of them, nay a carefully studied conversation, in which they reveal to us none but the best of their thoughts.”*

Welcome to my github profile, I am **bedwarshurts**, a minecraft server owner passionate about mathematics, physics, and programming. I am currently 17 years old and I love working on providing solutions through programming.

I am an avid programmer and software enthusiast with a passion for learning and sharing knowledge. My areas of interest include data science, game development and bot development. In the future, through my github account, I strive to contribute to the open-source community, but for now I am working for private projects for a minecraft server only.
<!-- ## 💼 Work Experience

- Fusion Land, Admin (2021 - 2022): I was part of the admin team on the Fusionland Minecraft SMP, responsible for player behaviour and ensuring that the server is working properly.
- Falix Nodes, 2nd Tier custommer support (2020 - 2021): Held the role as a support team member on falixnodes, responsible for answering complicated tickets and providing exceptional customer support, resigned since the company turned out to be making use of scummy practices. -->
